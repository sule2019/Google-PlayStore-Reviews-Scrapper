0,Amlan legend,"February 16, 2023",Too many glitches. Especially while playing a video there is suddenly a glitch where the video is not played and also u cannot text after that. The only solution is to restart the app. I am tired and sick of that bug. Also the loading time for search previous messages is so slow. Sometimes he search specific text area is completely black when I try to search a specific message.,553 people found this review helpful,2,Messenger
1,Cristian Jaramillo,"February 16, 2023","A decaying app! Lately when trying to send voice messages and it shows that it has been sent, it looks as though the message was 0 seconds but if i click on it, it plays the whole thing but makes me confused about if the receiver can hear the message or not. Also it seems as though I don't always get message notifications for some reason. And now that I try to search in conversations, it doesn't work!","2,126 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger
2,Stephanie Mitchell,"February 14, 2023","The app used to be amazing until a few days ago after it automatically updated. I no longer receive notifications. I've missed numerous messages because of this. I've restarted my phone a few times, checked to make sure all notifications are turned on in settings and of course they are. None of this has helped fix the problem. Very frustrating and ridiculous. I would like this issue to be resolved quickly.","4,090 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger
3,Stacey Desbiens,"February 20, 2023","App has gotten worse, for the past month I don't get any notifications of incoming video or chat calls, I don't even get notifications for messages either. They all just randomly stopped. This needs to be fixed. All my settings are fine too with thr phone and within the app. Hopefully you fix this bug soon!

4,Shery,"February 4, 2023","this one has great potential. But with every upcoming update it gets worse. My app crashes all the time. My screen intends to freeze, I can't open the chats neither send messages without bugs. I have to reset the app, sometimes my phone. It goes on for months already. I tried re-installing but nothing worked. When I manage to send my messages without the app crashing in the process, they don't get delivered even though my connection is great. It drains my battery like crazy.","5,768 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger

It's annoying and I have to end up asking the person to send it again. Also messages have not been wanting to send through properly, it all started after it's recent update, please fix this.","1,050 people found this review helpful",4,Messenger

The messages I sent took ages to be received and when photos were posted from others I couldn't see them, just a message saying someone had sent photos. That happened again overnight. Please revert to pre ""update"" and don't try fixing what isn't broken, just maintain the way it used to function because its been great. Video-call is much used.

8,Mebius Kramer,"February 11, 2023","The app is becoming worse and worse with every version. I used to regularly restart the app because the UI bugged, or the app wouldn't load new messages. I don't know how, but it's gotten worse and restarting it doesn't fix it. No notifications at all, searching for an element doesn't work and if it works makes the app not load anything, watching a video fills the app with graphic artifacts, and so on.","1,571 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger
9,Bayley Daniel,"February 13, 2023","Its so buggy. I have to reinstall it at minimum once a month. I've reinstalled it 3 times this week. It also consistently messes up other apps and phone functions. The good news is most problems seem to be fixed for a bit after a reinstall, and occasionally just clearing the cache is enough.

Picture-in-picture is barely working and even if it is, it is just blocking the touch (literally no touch). To end a call, I have to tell the person I am talking with to end it as when I press the end button nothing happenes. About the messages themselves, they send when they want, no matter if you have a connection or not. The videos don't have a preview anymore, you must click on them to view them.

13,Mark Edward Nathaniel Lalimarmo (NATHAN),"February 17, 2023","Some of the features aren't working. Pictures are not delievered, it just says ""sent a photo"". Other than that the themes that depend on what time of the day you're in, aren't working as well. Playing videos would make the app unusable, and you have to re-open the app just to make it work again. It's frustrating how many users there are, and yet these basic features aren't working.","1,223 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger
14,Jose Martinez,"February 15, 2023","I got a new phone a few months ago and redownloaded messenger but I found out that the phone I have used Bubbles instead of Chat Heads which are one the of the biggest downgrades I have seen in texting. You can't switch between the two, you are forced to use Bubbles and not only do you have to go into the app to text someone else, (making the bubbles pointless anyway) you barely get notified when getting a message. At the very least give us the option to switch between the two.",170 people found this review helpful,1,Messenger

17,Matthias Watermann,"February 3, 2023","Two things are really annoying. (1) Calls often abort before the other guy had a chance to pick up. Even if a connection is established, the audio is often missing. Since I don't know sign language the bandwidth is wasted. Without counting I'd say, 9 out of 10 attempts fail one way or the other. (2) There is no way I could find to backup the chats. Neither the non-private nor the encrypted chats can be exported to be saved elsewhere. IMO that disqualifies this app from serious work.

The notification setting for the app and in my phone settings is on. I uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared the cache, restarted my device several times. Followed 6 online fix guides.

21,William Taylor,"February 12, 2023","Notifications keep breaking. It seems like every few months they release an update which changes their notifications configuration. Where previously you could pull open a notification to see the previous X messages sent from a person, now you can only see the latest one. This means if a person sends 3 messages, you can no longer preview those messages, just the latest one. This affects smart watch users where notifications power content on the watch.

No, I don't want to see them. There is no way to disable it. The other thing is when you try to share/forward the message - it opens up the list of random people and maybe couple of recent chatted people. I suggest making that the user could add 'favorite' people. that list pop up before other random people in the list when you want to forward messages.","4,227 people found this review helpful",1,Messenger

Here's the list: - Cant ever receive calls, only a missed call notification after. - One side of the phone screen stops working when I'm on vid call. Worse when other party screen shares cuz then my entire screen freezes up. - When on vid call, the other party's audio goes on mute as soon as I say something then goes back to normal when I stop. - phone mic is still being used despite ending calls long ago. Had to close app from background to turn it off. FIX IT ASAP!",59 people found this review helpful,2,Messenger

For an app that's run by such a huge company, it is really poorly put together and feels like it was made by a college student in a few days. It is riddled with bugs, basic functionality has been removed, Android Auto compatibility is no longer a thing in Europe which just encourages people to use their phone whilst driving. Absolutely unacceptable and it's clear the developers have given up on it.",419 people found this review helpful,1,Messenger

It shows that they've seen the message by the time that the actual message was sent.,1 person found this review helpful,3,Messenger
