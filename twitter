0,Aryan Kumar,"January 30, 2023","My ""for you"" pages is a list. It stays in the same order and only nee rings are added from the too. But I'm tierd of seeing the same thing I had already. Why not make a ""discover"" section. The button would be at the bottom of the phone, like ""search"" has. The algorithm will decide what you like. I know I basically telling you to make something like reels and tiktoks but this has a bit of Twitter to it. It will have posts, videos and images, not just videos.","1,727 people found this review helpful",2,twitter

2,Ross Tarbard,"January 29, 2023","It appears that Android has lost the ability to direct message from someone's profile, even if you follow each other. This is on top of notifications or messages only showing intermittently, and sometimes not at all. It has become incredibly buggy recently, with pointless ""improvements"" which have done nothing to improve the app. I guess that's what happens when you sack all the competent people and keep the sycophants.","5,719 people found this review helpful",1,twitter

I've noticed that within the new chances to the platform, I can't chat directly on people's profiles anymore... Edit, they've brought this back.

I can use it on my phone to be able to tweet my followers on the go (when I'll have time) instead of using my computer. The only bug I've found so far is that when you're done seeing a picture or watching a clip at full screen or after reading a tweet and want to go back, it sends you back at the beginning of the page where you saw the tweet as if you're looking at that page the first time (loading screens after each portion). Can you look into this. Thank you.","6,099 people found this review helpful",5,twitter

The constant switching of positions of the reply/like/retweet buttons is confusing and not something that needed any change whatsoever.

While reading an interesting tweet, the app will just crash, and after that I can't find the tweet I was reading, unless it was on my home feed. I thought my phone was the problem, but I've realised other people have the same problem as well. You have also managed to mess things up by adding the useless ""For you"" tab.

It's too bad that whenever I log in to my new account on mobile, it SIGNS ME IN, and then goes back to my first account and doesn't even REGISTER as an option of accounts to select. Please fix this.

For a few days now they've basically shut off access to the service for many 3rd party apps. That wouldn't be a huge deal if the official app didn't suck so hard in the first place.

I'm not even talking about new features, I'm just talking about performance. The feed doesn't auto refresh and manually refreshing works 20% of the time. Watching a video and rotating to landscape mutes the sound and there's no way to unmute it without backing out of the thread. Many other issues.

Cropped pictures feature is TERRIBLE it makes user experience so much more complicated. I don't want to open every picture just to see what's in it.

Getting information quick is why ppl are using twitter. Why would you default my feed to a bunch of old tweets? Be less like Facebook. Also, I retweeted a reply to a post recently, and Twitter sent out the original post instead of the reply tweet that I clearly selected.

Reporting on celebrities however, is NOT newsworthy. Social: 3 out of 5. There are great topics being discussed and there can be interesting reads, but opinions are not facts, and facts are not facts. Hard for plebes to discern truth from fiction and fiction from fiction.
