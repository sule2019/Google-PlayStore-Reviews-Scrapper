0,Chinnaveni Y P,"February 18, 2023",It was great until I updated it. The new version lags and is very unresponsive jumps are delayed or just straight up ignored i hate this as all my progress is gone in a second seems intentional but ig it isn't. Anyways I will keep playing this until it reaches the extreme of my annoyance. And also I had alot of coins that disappeared after updating the app why's that?,"1,211 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers
1,Dinox,"September 28, 2022",Overall the game is nice but when with WiFi the game starts lagging and some weird things happen. After playing a lot the generation of obstacles or gets weird like the barrier are generated too close to each other so when you make the jump you end up getting caught . There are more problems but from now I am writing this much. But I recommend the game if you want to play without WiFi.,"42,974 people found this review helpful",2,subway_surfers
2,Laura Ts,"February 15, 2023","One of the few games that I enjoy playing to pass time. There are a few complaints though. I have so many characters which I never use, same for the boards, because they don't ""aid"" in any way to the gameplay (for this I'd say add more boards with powerups and also make the characters have some too). Biggest disappointment would be that when playing an event for a character that I already own, I get a very small reward in place of the character, like 5 keys, which can't really buy anything.","1,525 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers
3,Scott Bornhoft,"February 12, 2023",Watched a co-worker play this on our break one day and had to check it out. The game itself is fun and a great way to pass the time. My only complaint would be the amount of boosters. You pretty much have to pay in order to gain keys since you only get a few from watching ads. I also think that when you crash and get caught that you should have better ootions to restart. It's either watch an ad or lose your progress. There needs to be more options for using your coins to purchase keys.,"2,512 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers
4,PandaGaming,"February 10, 2023","I LOVE THIS! it's so good for when you want to use up some time and I love all the events :) I used to play it a few years back! no ads apart from when you clicked on watch ads for coins or watch ad to revive, now there's a lot! luckily you can click off them as soon as they come up mostly apart from that it's great I recommend it!!!!","1,393 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers
5,Naama delis,"February 10, 2023","Honestly, many have said this here but I'll add to them. The game itself is as fun as ever, but it feels like it's not the focus anymore with all of the gimmicks, and the ads cause the game to stop playing the music and sometimes crash. It gets kinda exhausting blocking all the popups as well. You're really gilding the lily, and that's a bummer.",289 people found this review helpful,3,subway_surfers
6,Slivestre Gonzalez,"February 24, 2023","The updates are amazing, the characters have lots of diversity, and the events are replayable and not boring. This is a pretty good game overall, but my main complaint with this game is that they keep reusing the same locations over and over, it is getting annoying, they've done this 3 times already (Cairo, Oxford & Barcelona). So I would give this 5 stars, but they need new locations or revisit old locations we haven't gotten for 2-3+ years.","10,051 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers
7,Luthien,"January 27, 2023","The game sound is completely gone after watching one (1) ad. I believe it must be an error, but it still is a bit annoying. The only way to have sound back is to close the app and restart. The gameplay is fun. Map designs could be improved to be less repetitive. Other than that, it's a fun game with many different goals.","4,731 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers
8,Bimarsha Dahal,"January 31, 2023","It's a great game and I've been following it since as long as I remember. A good game for time pass and daily entertainment. However I can't seem to handle annoying ad popups lately and it ruins my mood. Also I want to try and open mystery boxes but it's too slow and boring. Also after playing for a while there's no need for all the gold . I would love if the developers can make gold worthwhile, all in all a great game .

9,Evalyn Monroe,"February 18, 2023","Super fun to play when bored. An amazing game to take up your time. One thing is when I had first downloaded the game it glitched every few minutes when I swiped to move tracks, and it switched to the opposite direction. It doesn't happen anymore but it was weird. But overall it's one of my favorites.","1,888 people found this review helpful",5,subway_surfers

Remove all in-game notification while playing (they are really, very annoying). 3. Decrease the amount of ads. Don’t get me wrong, you guys did a great job. I love this game more than any other games, cause this is the first game I've ever played on an Android phone. So, please fix these issue.",308 people found this review helpful,3,subway_surfers
11,Danny Devito2.0,"December 26, 2022","The power-up boots are horrible. You can jump too far and lose, or you can jump off a train too high and bump into something and lose. I lost my one million+ streak because of this issue. I can fix my review when this issue is fixed. Other than the boots, this game is great. Entertaining for long periods of time. It's hard enough to keep you challenged and easy enough to keep you entertained. Plus in-game challenges. It's my favorite offline game. I just really wish they'd fix the boots.","13,234 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers
12,Jacob Stanton,"January 12, 2023","I have played this game for over a few years over many accounts. This game is one of my first picks if I'm bored during a class or in general. But my main problem has been things such as, when I start up the game, you are bombarded with as much as 5 microtransactions before you have even started playing. although the ads within the app are minimal, and appear only a few times as you close certain menus, it's very random when it decides if it appears. Otherwise it's good time passer.","5,651 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers
13,caos one,"January 24, 2023","How to ruin a perfectly fun game. Absolute classic and I was kind of shocked looking back into it after almost a decade. The core gameplay is as fun and addicting as ever, but all the gimicks, pop ups, things urging you to spend money, ads and other bloated stuff makes it so annoying to get to the gameplay in the first place and then makes you scores feel way less satisfying as you can always watch an ad to get a second chance, use an item to get a head start and so on. Quite sad.","9,787 people found this review helpful",2,subway_surfers
14,Ella Animatez,"December 22, 2022","I really liked this game. Great time killer if you ever need a quick game to play if you're at the doctor's office or something like that. Main problem I have with the game is the excessive ads and pressure on micro-transactions. Ads to revive, ads for extra coins, ads for practically everything. I really wanted to love this game, but the ads and constant pressure on getting you to buy something is what brings it down to a 3 for me.","11,741 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers
15,Dev The Weird,"February 11, 2023","This game is still as good as it was when I played it so many years ago. It's relaxing and a good callback to the past. Although the ads can be a bit annoying sometimes, they are very managable, and playing offline could fix that for anyone who doesn't want to pay any money. The game gives you plenty of chances to get materials, both in the gameplay and by giving you the choice to watch ads to get things like keys and coins. The events are also very fun and rewarding. 10/10, would reccommend.",437 people found this review helpful,5,subway_surfers
16,Arkinchala Prasetya,"February 2, 2023","This game brings nostalgia and is good to play when you're bored. But this game has too many pop up ads and everytime I watched an ad the game sound is just gone. Please fix this bug. Another thing, I don't mind the in app purchases since they're mostly cosmetic, but when you buy a ton of keys, you can basically pay to win which kinda suck that people with money can get a higher score.","1,538 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

It has quite nice skins and I like that they change the map every now and then. Overall fantastic game. 5 out of 5 from me. Edit A decade after and its still a decent game. But they have added a bunch of unnecessary stuff and it's ruining the core of the game. It used to be an fun and addictive game but now the devs are just using the game to get money. It still a decent game, just don't use $",16 people found this review helpful,2,subway_surfers
18,Matt Niemann,"January 9, 2023","Decent skill game that shoots itself in the foot by giving people a score multiplier, meaning getting a high score just means you can pay for it. I prefer games that don't show too many ads or at least give in-game compensation for ads, but getting an ad every time I want to check missions after a run is a little weird seeing as every screen typically has a ""watch ad for reward"" button on it.","2,170 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

So Santa is chasing me, and when there is an obstacle ahead for example like a fence or some sort, when I swipe left or right on my phone to dodge it, it sometimes will not work, so it will just let me hit the obstacle.

20,Daniel Zdroj,"January 18, 2023","My son first downloaded it 11 years ago on our tablet. It's great they added ways to get keys faster since we last played 9 years ago. Other than that it's still the same game. Easier to play using a smart phone vs tablet. One thing I'd love to see since it really hasn't changed much in 11 years is adding twists, loops, drops/climbs in the tracks and time warps, speed ups/slow downs. Make more items and characters able to be bought with coins. I have 11 million with nothing to use them on.",164 people found this review helpful,5,subway_surfers

I've been playing this game for years and accumulated many characters and boards, so having access to them again made me very happy :) This is one of my favorite go-to games when I want to destress and just veg. I have to admit though, that the new gameplay of collecting tokens can get a bit tedious, but overall the game is quite enjoyable so I will ignore that small annoyance.","1,464 people found this review helpful",5,subway_surfers

Worst part, I would have finished the event if the game didn't force me to wait days before moving to the next level. I waited and yet all my progress vanished. Probably because I wasn't connected to the internet when I reopened the game but that shouldn't be the case. This isn't the first time either.

24,Aliyah Detweiler,"January 24, 2023","I like it except for the boots, as others have stated. It really makes you hit other things and die. It saved my life like twice. I think that they should make it so the boots, if you crash with them, give the same result as the hoverboards (give you a life). As you run, you realize that it is the same track over and over, especially when you get in the millions. I dislike the ads also. Also a huge time waster.

But I'm giving a 3 bc I updated my game and now its not working. I have over 300 boards and yet I click to make them pop up during a run and nothing happens. The boards are a big part of gameplay so it makes me wonder what else is also bugging out and I just don't know yet. I've seen other reviews of the game glitching. Developers definitely look into this it is very frustrating!,28 people found this review helpful,5,subway_surfers

Not only am I unable to watch a video or pay to complete the mission, meaning I can not start a new mission, which is quite frustrating to say the least. However, if I try to Uninstall & reinstall the app, I risk losing my status, characters & outfits, but also boards I've accumulated.

I have over 4,000,000 coins and yet most of my characters only have one outfit and my boards don't have any powers, cuz I have less than 60 keys.

One, when you accidentally die in a run, you click on that ad, that ad never loads, and you're doomed. You're gonna have to waste your keys just to revive. And when you quit the run, an ad pops up. Two, the necessary ads don't come when you absolutely need it(loading ad), and it comes when you literally didn't expect it. I suggest adding an ad that is prepaid and will come up later when you click on the watch ad button.",159 people found this review helpful,3,subway_surfers

From many years I am playing this game but I think when you start playing a lot and become a pro, then, I think speed must increase from the starting of game because it seems very boring in the starting when your player is a lazy slow turtle and you feel to quit but don't want to. So, I request from the subway surfers controllers to look after the very same.

190,Galactic,"September 19, 2022","It's fun- the gameplay is how I remember all those years ago but, honestly, it kinda went downhill. Picture this: you're playing this and want to earn a high score (this game has a ranked system) So you play, and then realize you can watch ads to revive yourself for another chance in your run. That's not a problem- until you realize you get *unlimited* ads and can revive as many times as you want, turning the game into a ""who can revive the most"" instead of actual skill.","7,730 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

However, while I do love the style in the game, a lot of the special characters are in bundle packs which you have to buy. For the Day of the Dead month, I really wanted a few of them, but they were only able to be bought with actual money, which is disappointing.

Still no audio. You can unlock new surfers, new boards, same game, same obnoxious monetisation scheme. Why would I pay you microtransactions for a wasteland of involuntary ads between the exact... same... experience...

It can definitely take a while to get all the characters, boards, & achievements, but it's worth the time investment, imo. The gameplay is fast-paced and never boring. Some of the characters & skins are actually really great. My only complaint is the sheer number of cheaters that pollute this game. Aside from that, I'd 100% recommend.

The updates are regular and there's surprisingly a lot to do in a game that looks rather simple. The gameplay is rather well known so I won't go too far into it, just that the simple concept of it might just be what you need to de stress. It's unfortunately rare to find many good ""free-to-play"" games these days but Subway Surfers gets it right.",10 people found this review helpful,5,subway_surfers

First and foremost, if you need to restore your phone, you loose all progress, or if you change phone. Your progress from before is not saved, except your high score. The high score becomes a problem if you got to max multiplier and need to redo missions. Of course you can pay to skip missions (not real money, in-game currency), but it is still annoying. That's why it only gets 3 stars. It would get 4.5 stars if not for the above. This it is surprisingly fun to play and you do get ads but it is well balanced and you decide when to watch (for the most part).","1,274 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

I can see ""save me"" keys could be used super fast, thus super appealing to buy. I enjoy the Christmas theme. If you want me playing all year, I need a variety of maps. I'm also a fan of building my own team in the games I play so the different characters that appear after a certain number attempts at the mystery box and total coins, is a good thing. Right now, my only gripe is thst the map is constantly changing on every run, so I'll never be able to pattern out each level. I assume that was the game maker's intent, but without the possibility of unlocking new levels, I loose the different environment incentive. So, for now I'll assume the point is to rack up coins in order to play with different characters and use different items.","1,054 people found this review helpful",5,subway_surfers

1462,A Google user,"September 16, 2018","When it comes to graphics, the style is cartoon like and fun. The visuals aren't too overwhelming, making for a simple and good looking experience. When it comes to the animations, it seems fun and exciting. Until, that is, you get a new character and realize all the characters are carbon copies of each other in both gameplay and animations. Once you start playing for a while and start getting used to the animations, you may notice some inconsistencies. For example, if you get a jump boost powerup (not to be confused with the double jump) and it ends while you are on the ground, the bounce walking animation will continue to play until you do something. The music is ok at first, but quickly gets annoying, so I would recommend muting the game. The gameplay feels natural; up to jump, left and right to move, down to roll. The only real issue I have with the gameplay is the hoverboards. To activate the hoverboard, you must double tap the screen. This, of course, can happen by complete accident with your thumbs so close to the screen. The powerups don't get in the way, and feel satisfying to grab and use. While playing, you can complete missions to boost your score. At first glance, this seems like a good idea, but gets old fast. Some missions are things you may complete on accident, such as rolling fourty times. Others are just a waste of time, not out of challenge, but out of a challenge supplement: waiting. I currently have a mission that says I have to complete four word hunts. For those of you who don't know, a word hunt is just that, a hunt for letters to make a word that rewards the player afterwards, usually with coins, mystery boxes, and hoverboards. The thing is, word hunts only happen once a day, meaning I have to play for four days just for one score boost. One could argue that I could pay coins to skip it, but that's just cheap. Overall, the game is ok, but could definitely use some improvements.",1 person found this review helpful,4,subway_surfers

Then, when you exit the game because you can't do anything, any boards you used are not returned and progress towards the daily rewards meaningless. Apart from that and a few visual glitches regarding power ups, it's a pretty cool game.",787 people found this review helpful,3,subway_surfers

If I'm going to be doing these challenges that sometimes take up to a month to complete, then I want more than 8 little keys. At least double them up. Also I sometimes wish the players had powers and abilities like the boards instead of just outfit changes.",3 people found this review helpful,4,subway_surfers
1496,Disparatepanic,"December 21, 2020","It's not half bad, it's a good time waster and can be quite fun to try and beat your high score but, there are quite a few issues that I want to point out. 1. The game is full of trashy characters that cost too much money for what they're worth. 2. Sometimes the gameplay can be unfair eg., You slide under an obstical but there's a jump obstical that's impossible to see after. Leading you to end your run. There are a few more issues but these are the glaring ones that I'd though I'd point out.","1,301 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place.

I really liked it though, especially that you can watch videos to get rewards without a limit. I had it for a few months, and it was great. But then the controls started getting all choppy, like if I rolled it would roll 1.5 seconds after I rolled, so if I rolled at the last second I would end up crashing. It also won't let me watch videos for rewards anymore. When I open it through PlayStore though it works well.",95 people found this review helpful,3,subway_surfers

When you mute the sound effects/music, pause the game and come back, or an ad shows up, it unmutes after that, while the mute button is still showing as activated, so you can't mute it again. Also, whenever you use the power jumper and land on a rooftop, there are no coins to be collected as it used to be. I love playing this game so much. Please fix it in the next update.","6,097 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

I am getting connection errors when I am connected. The missions just hung when counting barriers I was stuck at 2 and have more than a million points. When you have a magnetic and get a jumper the graphics make it impossible to see what and where the power pickup is.

For example, the prices for any good stuff is usually 120,000 to 980,000 and you might be thinking that with time you could progress well but to fully completed the game you would have to play a couple years and spend real money.

And a couple of missions that either aren't hard or aren't easy; there has to be rewards that are in between easy and difficult.

It seems that the once simple and user-friendly menus have been changed to an app-store-esque mess. As well, ads are a constant and annoying nuisance, I often get them between changing menus, and they bother you with more ads to double everything (which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't already frustratingly frequent).

The icon layout has changed (for the worse, in my opinion), so it is difficult to find anything, and there seem to be many more adverts to wade through. It is also buggy e.g. it tells you to bump five bushes or jump 30 barriers, but it doesn't increment the counter. Power-ups no longer ""sparkle"" so they are often missed.

Just don't like the fact that when you watch an ad for a reward it says no wifi and doesn't let me. But when I skip the ad reward and go back to playing and it gives me an unskippable ad.

If you didn't know, the longer you stay alive, the faster you run. There are some confusing things but it's ok. The only 2 big problems is the amount of paying you have to do to play and many adds.

1548,tionna frazier,"July 1, 2022",I play this game very often. I really enjoy the game it's fun and I love the different theme's each month. However with the new 10-year anniversary super runner challenge I have been experiencing issues. Every time I get to a different stage and then leave the game and come back it starts me back to stage one which is completely unfair. The problem needs to be fixed.,"2,777 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers
1549,gonna cry?,"September 15, 2020","While trying to get a revive using ads, ads may sometimes not work and it doesn't give the player a chance to go back and just end the run, or perhaps for some like me. It simply stays as a black loading screen. Nothing wrong with an ad not working, but the data while running gets erased! The mystery boxes earned while running and the top run score doesn't change after restarting the game! The others are updated thankfully but I just hope this issue gets fixed in the next update.","1,760 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

There was a glitch in the special power zap sideways, and whenever you zap, your hoverboard animation speeds up and I liked it. Also there was old animations for the character idles, the character running animations and hoverboard animations too, and I kinda miss that.",907 people found this review helpful,5,subway_surfers

1632,Partyo HD,"September 6, 2020","Pretty good concept of the game and its really well done. Played this about 5 years ago and i cant get enough of it. A few recommendations though , would be like levels ; something like a harder version of missions, as it might get a little boring wit the endless mode , and if I keep doing missions after x30 mulitiplier it will just give me more mystery boxes , but while it gives character tokens , if you have all of them , they would probably give you either cash or keys , which gets boring after awhile . maybe try to add a twist in the game. I would like to see some levels in the game. another thing would be increasing the maximum multiplier to maybe 50 , so that people can get a higher score. I hope this review can help improve the game. keep it up.","1,810 people found this review helpful",4,subway_surfers

I've only paid once for something cause I really wanted it, but Ive never paid after that! And I have a bunch of characters all earned with no money! Some characters that have a limit when you can get them most come back for a few days so if you want to buy them again! You can also collect boards! Which help you a lot in the game and they pretty cool too! Also has missions to complete for rewards and power ups!","1,421 people found this review helpful",5,subway_surfers

Some of the sounds became completely atonal. The artwork's been redrawn in a chunkier, less imaginative style. The interface has become more bloated than it needs to be. Flickering is almost constant. Playing this before & now is like going from 60 to 30 fps - terrible for a game that often requires precision. May stop playing the game altogether.","2,310 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

Won't be wasting my time like that again on this game.","11,613 people found this review helpful",1,subway_surfers
1718,A Google user,"March 13, 2019","With the latest ad update, ads fail to load in properly, and then when they're done, Subway Surfers force restarts itself. Any progress you may have had in a run is gone, any tokens you have watched an ad to get more of? Gone. Watch an ad for more keys? Ad fails to load, game resets. I'll raise my rating when the problem is corrected. It's such a shame too, the game is fun, and the core gameplay loop is addictive. I don't even mind ads, I just don't like the fact that they now break the game.","2,406 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

Amazing time-killer and very fun. However, I seem to be running into a bug often. Whenever I watch an ad to revive, my game gets stuck. My character keeps running but I cannot swipe; I can only jump and roll. And then I have to restart. Plus, even if my internet is good, the game lags time and again. An inconvenience. Otherwise, great game.",21 people found this review helpful,4,subway_surfers

1721,Millindén,"June 9, 2020",The new update made buying mystery boxes much slower. It always loads before I get the box and that makes it really irritating when I try to get the jackpot. The animations when the loot comes out of the box has also started to lag when opening many in a row. The controls also feel different after the update. For example switching lanes feels slower than before. I don't hate everything about the new update (the new season hunt and character menu is good). I really don't know how to rate this :(,95 people found this review helpful,1,subway_surfers

I can't see the power ups anymore either, their glow is gone and it made them blend in with the background. That is not good. The new characters are also super pricey, I don't like that about the game either. Also I'm waiting for my Gear Board. I've collected so many of those compasses and I've reached the board.

But that's undermined by each character playing exactly the same. It would be nice if each surfer had different stats or even their own special moves apart from with the hoverboards. The graphics are nice, but I've noticed that the characters don't emote as much as they do in the series, and the absence of voice acting feels...odd.

I was so close to getting the new character since I was at stage 4/5, but then I logged in the game, all rhe progress disappeared.","5,104 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

The paying perspective. For the ad problem there is just way too many ads but I ain't got no money so I'm not getting rid of them. And for the paying problem all of the characters that are interesting cost real money, now don't get me wrong I love saving up keys and buying characters that way but real money is too far too me!

1800,Lucas “Chronics”,"May 20, 2022",Honestly I like the app but there are a bunch of problem #1. There is like nothing to do maybe add like a new map or something. #2. The jump sneaker just remove them they are annoying because you accidentally pick them up and its annoying playing with them. #3. The character and boards are a bit overpriced maybe like bring them down just a bit so that more people are able to get them. But overall great game.,2 people found this review helpful,4,subway_surfers

After a score of 400.000 coin lines may miss coins. Not getting a medal at end of weekly run. Besides that, the new character and surfboards gallery/shop needs work, it is quite overwhelming.

I really love this game, and I play it all the time, but this newest update makes me not want to play at all. the new graphics feel childish and make it much more difficult to see. to camera angle when you jump(especially with the pogo stick)makes it really hard to see. I keep missing powerups and letters because they're very hard to see. the menus are very difficult to navigate and are much more confusing than they used to be. I feel like the update ruined the game.",258 people found this review helpful,2,subway_surfers

Item costs in game can be steep and off putting to new comers. I tend to get the permanent coin multipliers in endless runners that I enjoy a lot, and it helps a lot in this game but is by no means a requirement.

The problem is that the game sometime lags, so when I am trying to dodge trains and obstacles the character on the screen suddenly stops running and the next thing I know the character has collided with a train.

Also it could have levels with new things to do each time to keep the player motivated rather than to start from the begining every single time.

Wordy Weekend characters are dressed in their default outfits which makes one wonder why we buy new outfits. There's the problem of crashing with hoverboard and still getting caught by inspector when at a tunnel. Mission don't register as complete when done.

Have been in an off and on kinda relation with this game ever since it was launched and I was still in highschool. But now I am a regular player. So the only reason I am cutting one star is because there is a glitch oe bug or whatever you wanna call it. Sometimes when I get the jetpack, instead of going up directly in the air, like it usually does, the character gets crashed in whatever is in front. Like a train or a barrier. And when I watch an ad to continue, the character has jetpack on but is on the ground, sorta swimming, and still jumping and running. When the jetpack is finished, they still have the jetpack on, when I exit to main menu they still have the jetpack on even in the main screen where the character is just standing spraying the train with subway surfers written on it. When I start a new game the character still has the jetpack on, and once again kinda swims through the game, feels like flying but still on tbe ground running and jumping.

You don't get to continue even after watching an ad, your reward just vanishes into thin air. And despite having a good internet connection, ads that continue the save don't even load whereas ads are littered everywhere else obnoxiously.

1983,André Moura,"May 30, 2022","This is the greatest running game ever! I really like it and I'll always like it, but I have some ideas that could improve the game: 1 - About coins and keys collection: It could be easier and faster to collect and gather coins or keys, because it really takes a lot of time to gather them (even a small amount!) So, the game should make us gather money faster, because, major part of people don't have enough time to play (like me) and we ""waist"" the time we already don't have tryna gather them.",215 people found this review helpful,4,subway_surfers
1984,They Call Me Ice 'Cause I'm Cool,"August 9, 2022","It's fun and addicting, but also VERY glitchy. 1st; if you run on a train and switch lanes, you can sometimes bump into nothing. 2nd, if you run fast enough and switch lanes at the right moment when you're about to crash into a train, you'd stay on your lane and phase through the train while the model is between the 2 lanes. Oh, and ads are every X clicks on popups. Problem how many popups there are. It's also inconsistent where it places you when you bump into something when switching lanes.","3,593 people found this review helpful",3,subway_surfers

You can't get the champion medal 'cause of the scorecap. New music's ok, but there should be an option to play the original. Another bug: I had the ""uprock"" board before, It disappeared and now the game says I have to complete this hunt to regain it. The 2048 key revive cap is annoying, increase/remove it.

1996,Dante Sombra,"September 21, 2020","Fast paced, never gets boring. It's one ""stage"" so there's no ""end"" but I like racking up high scores and earning stuff to get better hover boards with different features. Little tip: go into settings and choose the option to see ads that are based on what you look at online. You can get lots of free stuff watching ads, but you'll see ads for stuff you're actually interested in. Plus many of those ads are only 15 seconds long instead of just 30 second app ads, which means it goes by faster.","2,622 people found this review helpful",5,subway_surfers
