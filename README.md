# Google-PlayStore-Reviews-Scrapper
Google PlayStore Reviews Scraper scraps reviews and feedback from mobile apps on the PlayStore using selenium

The Reviews Scraper collects data such as user username, ratings/stars, date and review, providing valuable insights into the user's experience of using the app. The data collected can be analyzed to identify patterns, user preferences, and areas for improvement. This information is useful for app developers and businesses as it can be used to improve the app's performance, functionality, and user experience.

The Reviews Scraper is a powerful tool that saves developers time and effort by automating the process of collecting and analyzing user reviews.
There are other tools that does the same such as https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scrapper/ and https://pypi.org/search/?q=google+play+scrapper so you can also look into those.

Sample dataset scrapped for the top ten mobiles apps on the playstore can also be found in the files.

The main code is in the Playstore_Reviews_Scrapping.ipynb, just follow the instructions.
Feel free to mosify and add additional features as you wish.

The automation part of the scrapper will be further developed in the near future
