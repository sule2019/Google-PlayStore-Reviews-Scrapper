0,Sam Paul,"February 10, 2023","From one of the best music applications to one of the worst. Spotify just going down. Showing one ad every 30 minutes was fine. But showing ad after every single song, not good and spoils the mood. Songs might be limited but ad is unlimited. But the music this app has is just amazing. A wide variety of songs, a wide variety of moods.","1,435 people found this review helpful",2,spotify
1,Indu Rawat,"February 19, 2023",Spotify is a very good app for those people who want to listen tousic or love singing. The one thing I like is that there are lyrics and they are time synced- meaning you click on a line and it starts playing from there. The quality is superb and it is clear. The range of songs is unbelievable and you can find almost every song on this app.,127 people found this review helpful,5,spotify
2,Mohit Pandey,"February 17, 2023","I was using this app since a long time but since last 2 updates, its experience is continuously being worst. app always shows no internet connection on wifi and on mobile data also. Other apps are running smooth in my phone. but this one sucks. I love the collection of yours and the sound quality also. but this is really disappointing. please fix this bug to make sure that your users need not to go anywhere else.",554 people found this review helpful,1,spotify
3,Shubhra Shrey,"February 18, 2023","Yes, like all, it's those constant ads. Initially it was 2 ads per 4 or 5 songs, then it was 2 ads per 2 or 3 songs. It was still fine. But now, its 3 ads per 2 or 3 songs and it's frustrating. Not all can afford or would like to take a premium. So kindly look after the ads. Apart from that I'd prefer spotify because it introduced me to different artist with the kind of music I listen to. Also, spotify streams means a lot to an artist's career as well.","2,958 people found this review helpful",3,spotify

It shows a completely different playlist or does not show any song at all. I have to go back to my phone to sync music again.",106 people found this review helpful,4,spotify
5,Maneeshwar Muni,"February 20, 2023",Spotify has one of the largest collection of songs. I really like the interface of the app which is very smooth and easy to navigate through the application. The quality of the songs are top notch. After using it for a month I bought Premium to enjoy the music without any interruption of ads. For music I can really say this is the best app I have found.,16 people found this review helpful,5,spotify

Some buttons at the top, some at the corner, can't go to album when you click on the track name, and to make things worse, i can't see the album art which has gone under after that update which plays short clip of song. Still an ardent fan of top notch quality this app deliver, yet can't take this interface nonsense anymore.",816 people found this review helpful,3,spotify

One problem that I've been facing is the recommendations of podcasts. The unwanted podcasts show up on my Spotify account frequently and I guess there's no option to get rid of them.

9,Rajan Mishra,"February 3, 2023","The app is amazing and gives so many vast range options to choose from, both music and podcasts. I really like listening on this platform and the Spotify wrap is simply amazing!! I am always for the year end to see mine. The only issue is that it doesn't give you option to download a single song. You can only download a playlist and as soon as you add a new song to that playlist it automatically starts to download that song which is annoying because it aquires unnecessary space in your phone.","2,267 people found this review helpful",5,spotify
10,Dheeraj Joshi,"February 16, 2023","I've been using Spotify premium since 2 years. And Spotify is a pretty good Music App as compared to other music streaming apps in terms of sound quality and recommendation of songs, but there are few bugs which needs to be fixed. 1 : Whenever I make a new playlist on spotify it is visible on my profile but when I turn my private playlist to public it's not visible on my profile. 2: Sometimes song stops or changes by itself in the middle of streaming.",21 people found this review helpful,4,spotify

I've seen a major bug for the first time and have nowhere to report it, the bug starts when you get the app in the background and pause the music for some time, the music controls are still visible in the notification bar but the song still doesn't play, further when you go into the app you can't see the song's play/pause control bar on the bottom of the app, yet if you see the playlist you're playing from on home, it shows the symbol of playing.","2,415 people found this review helpful",1,spotify
12,Nayan Joshi,"December 7, 2022","The best music streaming app ever!!! I'm using it since its launch and it's just gone better and better. The best part is the Wrapped mode we get at the end of each year wrapping all the songs and telling us about the top 5s of each category. Just one issue, please allow individual song download.

Press on a song after watching an ad, ad. Say no thanks to the 30 minutes of playing, AD. Very annoying. Would appreciate if you would tone it down on that. Thanks.

But when it comes to basic functionality, this app is a nightmare. It takes forever to start, sometimes has to be restarted multiple times to get songs to play, and when I don't have internet, I have to change it to offline mode to even be able to use it since Spotify can't just accept that there's no service currently.",462 people found this review helpful,3,spotify

The hide song feature does not work even when you go into the artist and album to hide a specific song it still appears and plays on playlists. The app moves at a glacial pace when you don't have wifi, I understand there is an offline mode in the settings, but if the device does not have an internet connection it will take anywhere from 3-10 minutes to load songs you already have on your device.",327 people found this review helpful,3,spotify

This new update honestly is very frustrating; I don't like it. You can't choose what song you want to listen to in a Playlist, you have to skip through till you get to it. You are no longer able to organize it; only able to click on the song and play a portion of it. Please change it back to the way it was.

The lyrics The sound quality, However I'm very and deeply annoyed with this app. I put together a small play list to listen to all the songs I like. What does Spotify do? Add and play song I never liked and when I try to get ride of them and play my liked songs it doesn't work. It only plays the song I want for 10 seconds before returning to the one I don't want to hear. Even searching for a new song won't make it go away.

I got premium to listen to my favorite music ad free and its great and all, but I hate that it closes everytime I use it with google maps. Both apps are updated and it never did this a year or so ago, from my experience. I have an android so not sure if that has something to do with it, but its really frustrating to drive without music for hours.",437 people found this review helpful,1,spotify

Also, it's just not the right app for podcasts at all. It cannot play them in order, despite being capable of listing them in order if you manually specify to do so. Spotify leaves a LOT to be desired. My absolute least favorite audio app.",190 people found this review helpful,2,spotify
20,Logan Simmons,"February 12, 2023","I like the app. Its not a bad app. But there is one thing that irritates me. I understand that Spotify wants people to buy premium, I get that, but they need to change it so that whoever doesn't have premium, when they pick a playlist and it's random, it needs to play a song FROM THE PLAYLIST! It's very frustrating when I try and play something from a playlist, and as I don't have premium, Spotify just plays a random song from god knows where. It's really starting to piss me off so fix it!!!!",218 people found this review helpful,3,spotify
21,Toad Taylor,"February 13, 2023","As someone who uses the free version of the app, I can honestly say it's not a great experience for listening to music. Ads are very frequent, and you have very little control over what songs are actually played. It'll often switch you off your current playlist to what it claims to be ""similar"" with no way to get back outside of switching playlists altogether. The only real use I've found for this app is for podcasts, which thankfully don't randomly shuffle you around to somewhere else.",289 people found this review helpful,2,spotify

The PC version is so much better, even without premium the app is still usable, with much less ads and it offers more features, such as queue and the option to listen to what you actually want without having to skip through random songs. Overall, the PC experience is much better. Most listen on the go anyway. The experience should be the same on all platforms.",73 people found this review helpful,1,spotify

Could you guys add back the feature to be able to see song covers when rearranging the playlist? It helps me a lot when it comes to trying to organize playlists, which I do a lot. I used to be able to do it on my tablet before, but now I am completely unable to do it.

But if I click on the first album, listen, and then go back to see the next one, the list is gone and replaced by some other list that I don't want to see.

I enjoy shuffling up my playlist so I can just sit and listen to what I want to in a random order... then this new 'Enhanced Shuffle' is introduced, which will put similar songs just into the playlist.

Second, I noticed it would keep playing the same songs. Third, I have all my downloads saved on my sd card. For some unknown reason, it would move all my saved songs to my phone's internal memory.

This is REALLY annoying if you want to add a song to multiple playlists. It means that instead of going back to the 3 dots again, you have to re-focus so the now playing song shows w/cover art, to get the 3 dots option available to tap. It's a small thing, but SO annoying.",24 people found this review helpful,1,spotify

On every other device except your phone, you can rewind songs, skip forth and back and there is very little ads. However on a phone, you cannot skip songs like on other devices and there is an ad every 2 songs. I use Spotify on a laptop and on a tablet so I'm loving it there but it's useless on a phone.

I pay for a subscription; there's been no issues in the past with skipping songs. It's very frustrating. I've been a user of Spotify for years and use the app almost daily- the new update has made my listening experience terrible the last 2-4 weeks.

Once a song finishes, the time will just keep going, so it'll show that I'm 5 minutes in to a 3 minute song, and I can't play anything else when it does this, so you have to exit out and go back in. Also, the ads were bearable before, but now there are way too many.

If you pause the playlist to do something, and then come back later (15 minutes, 2 hours, doesn't matter) it loses what you were playing last and you have to start something new, (or re-find what you had just started listening to.

Heard that it used to be a option for delete but has since been removed.,0,2,spotify
2033,Brianna Raymond,"January 20, 2023","Hello people of google. I am just rewriting my review. So, here we go... Where do I even start? This app is AMAZING! I really like listening to music on here, and the app is really easy to use, and I have also created a few playlists. The only issue is in order to get all the features, you have to pay for premium, so I don't, and the ads are pretty annoying. But other than that, this app is pretty neat! (:",0,4,spotify

2036,WORLD STXR,"December 24, 2022",It's gotten to the point where it's not even enjoyable using the free version of Spotify. Try to get free 30 minutes? Watch atleast a good minutes worth of ads just to not get 30 minutes of free music. The Playlists are now buggy and hard to make because there's no longer a preview feature.,12 people found this review helpful,1,spotify
